# AIFF Explorer

This is a tool for visualizing the IFF chunk structure of an AIFF file. It can also parse and display the field content of common AIFF chunk types.


Some example AIFF files for testing the functionality of this tool can be found [here](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/AIFF/Samples.html).
